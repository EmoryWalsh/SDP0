Creation of design file

Updated the design file include the component diagram that illustrates how the
front-end aspects of the code with interact with the back-end to create a
working site. Also tables of the databases to show what each table should store
in each column. The site map was slightly improved to be more accurate. Wording
in some areas were changed to be more technically correct. Added a way for users
to only be able to contribute to a story once. Major web pages, functions, and
variables were also laid out to give a general guideline of what should be
implemented.

Created app.py, base.html, homepage.html, landingpage.html. For app.py I added
routes for root, home, logout, login, and register. Also, created the methods
for each of the routes. I made the design for the html files.

SQLite Methods
Join- there are multiple methods to query data from two or more tables,
      which include "inner join", "left join", and "cross join". This would
      be useful in figuring out a user's total contributions by retrieving
      all the edits they made from each story's tables
Inner Join -
  Syntax:   SELECT a1, a2, b1, b2         // column name(s)
            FROM A                        // table(s) to read from
            INNER JOIN B ON B.f = A.f;    // if column f in B equals column f in
                                          // A, return in a table

Left Join - used on tables with related columns (same name)
  Syntax:   SELECT a, b                 // column name(s)
            FROM A                      // table(s) to read from
            LEFT JOIN B ON A.f = B.f    // if column f in A equals column f in B; also works for > and <
            WHERE search_condition;
