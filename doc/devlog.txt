Updated the design file include the component diagram that illustrates how the
front-end aspects of the code with interact with the back-end to create a
working site. Also tables of the databases to show what each table should store
in each column. The site map was slightly improved to be more accurate. Wording
in some areas were changed to be more technically correct. Added a way for users
to only be able to contribute to a story once. Major web pages, functions, and
variables were also laid out to give a general guideline of what should be
implemented.

Created app.py, base.html, homepage.html, landingpage.html. For app.py I added
routes for root, home, logout, login, and register. I made the design for the
html files.
