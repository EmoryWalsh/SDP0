Creation of design file

williamL -- 2019-10-20 05:28
Updated the design file include the component diagram that illustrates how the
front-end aspects of the code with interact with the back-end to create a
working site. Also tables of the databases to show what each table should store
in each column. The site map was slightly improved to be more accurate. Wording
in some areas were changed to be more technically correct. Added a way for users
to only be able to contribute to a story once. Major web pages, functions, and
variables were also laid out to give a general guideline of what should be
implemented.

Created app.py, base.html, homepage.html, landingpage.html. For app.py I added
routes for root, home, logout, login, and register. Also, created the methods
for each of the routes. I made the design for the html files.

SQLite Methods

Join- there are multiple methods to query data from two or more tables,
      which include "inner join", "left join", and "cross join". This would
      be useful in figuring out a user's total contributions by retrieving
      all the edits they made from each story's tables

Inner Join - selects certain rows from two or more tables and prints a table of
              values given that the conditional is true
  Syntax:   SELECT a1, a2, b1, b2         // column name(s)
            FROM A                        // table(s) to read from
            INNER JOIN B ON B.f = A.f;    // if column f in B equals column f in
                                          // A, return in a table

Left Join - used on tables with related columns (same name)
            all rows are included but the ones that do not match the
            conditional are replaced will NULL
  Syntax:   SELECT a, b                 // column name(s)
            FROM A                      // table(s) to read from
            LEFT JOIN B ON A.f = B.f    // if column f in A equals column f in B; also works for > and <
            WHERE search_condition;     //

Cross Join - given table A with k rows and table B with n rows, a set is
              produced with k x n rows. (Similar to foiling in algebra).

  Syntax: SELECT *
          FROM A
          CROSS JOIN B;

Programming Sucks

In the real world, most programs are broken most of the time, due to various factors, but especially the lack of coordination.
What can we do about this?
1. Communicate
2. Put meaningful comments in our code
3. Don't spend hours trying to make things perfect when they already work well because it will never be perfect

(If you thought that was a multiple choice question, the answer is 4. All of the above)

avrahamiB -- 2019-10-22 09:25
Created a function to facilitate inserting rows into a table
Usage:
  insert(<table_name>, <params>)
It can handle 2, 3, or 4 parameters, based on the number of columns in the given table

avrahamiB -- 2019-10-22 18:40
Added new table and adjusted parameters of other tables, as shown on design doc.

Created a function to update a table when someone adds something new to a story
Usage:
  update(<user_id>, story_id>, <added text>)

avrahamiB -- 2019-10-23 09:25
Made update command also change the edits table

Created a function to tell whether a person has edited a particular story
Usage:
  has_edited(<user_id>, <story_id>)
It will return true if the user has edited that story before, and false if not

continued working on app.py
  worked on register route, adding a function to add the credentials to the users table
  added error flashing under register to make sure none of the fields are blank
  added the error flashing to the html file 
removed data.db file
